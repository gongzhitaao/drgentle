    "abstract": "This paper uses a different econometric model and more data compared to the first Canadian data paper published in 2007. This is also a different model from the UK data paper that was published in 2010. Other sections of the paper have also been updated. This article suggests that the real interest rate should be considered in the model for any empirical study on the inflation-unemployment trade-off. Two empirical models are developed to incorporate the real interest rate in addition to inflation rates and real wages, namely, New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) and triangle model. Both of them are estimated using annual data from Canada from 1935 through 2010. The finding shows that the interest rate plays a significant role in explaining the inflation/unemployment association. The authors maintain that all economists should at least consider the real rate of interest, in Phillips Curve Analysis.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that any empirical study on the inflation-unemployment trade-off requires the inclusion of the real interest rate in the model as any changes in the interest rate affects the capital used by the firms and thus leads to an effect on the level of employment in the economy. To test the validity of this argument, an empirical model is developed which includes the real interest rate as one of the explanatory variables in addition to inflation and real wages. The model is estimated using the annual time series data from the United States for the period from 1939 through 2007, which is available from Gordon (2009a) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The estimated results indicate that the interest rate variable is indeed significant in explaining the Phillips Curve.",

To justify this argument a Phillips curve model is developed, which includes the real interest rate in addition to inflation and real wages. After the diagnosis of the time series properties of the data, an error correction model is developed and estimated using a set of US annual data from 1948 to 1996. The estimated parameters of the model do suggest that one should really take into consideration of the real interest rate while analysing the Phillips curve. A nonnested test (F-test) also suggests that the Phillips curve model with real interest rate as an additional variable performs better than the conventional method that does not include the real interest rate.",

    "abstract": "The United States Unified Budget Act (UBA) was implemented in 1969. Subsequently, all federal revenues, even those designated as going to trust funds, were used to determine each current fiscal year’s Unified Budget’s size of the surplus or deficit. Social Security and other trust funds are held in trust and by mandate and all are used to hold Treasury securities. The time period of data used in this paper is from 1940 through 2012. Any domestic or foreign holders of U.S. Treasury bonds need to have a complete picture of the financial status of the United States federal government. China and Japan hold more U.S. Treasury securities than any other foreign country. Yet most of the debt is held domestically in the USA. The UBA employs a cash accounting system, instead of an accrual system. In order for the public to have a more complete picture of future federal obligations, we propose this level of transparency. In addition to presenting the UBA cash accounting system dollar amounts, both the Congressional Budget Office and the President’s Office of Management and Budget should publicly provide estimated accrual accounting system dollar amounts. Any reputable, large business firm does so and even some small business firms do.",

To address Social Security Trustees' concerns, President Bush, in his postelection speech, reported that one of the legacies of his administration would be to reform the Social Security system. Farm operators tend to be older, on average, than people in other populations, meaning that changes in Social Security would more likely be of near-term concern to them. Although there is still considerable debate on whether reform is necessary or desirable, this article reports on what a changed Social Security system might look like, and how changes in the system might affect farmers' need for additional savings.",

    "abstract": "In this article issues concerning national commonalities and regional differences in the United States regarding private land and outdoor recreation are reviewed. Based on the particular cultural and political backgrounds of each region, it is hypothesized that landowners will exhibit degrees of differences in their attitudes regarding public access to private land. Data is from the latest decennial survey, the National Private Landowners Survey (NPLOS 1995-96), as well as from per capita state and local government spending on recreation, provided from the 1992 Census of Government. There is a discussion of the philosophical views on land in the United States, with some specifics for each region. It was found that there is a positive relationship between allowing public access to private land and the regional, state, and local spending on parks and recreation. The historical cultural differences between regions also seem to be of some importance, though not conclusive. Implications for marketing and income opportunities associated with fee-based private land recreation in different regions of the nation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Outdoor recreation on private land is influenced by myriad factors. To provide background and context on these factors, this chapter first overviews the private land situation in the United States and provides general information and discussion related to ownership and tenure, land-use patterns, legal restrictions, and economic conditions, including taxation issues. Implications of these factors with respect to use of private land for outdoor recreation are also discussed.  Overall, there is little extant information on recreational use and access to private land. To help fill this information gap, the National Private Landowners Survey (NPLOS) was recently conducted (1995-1996). A major focus of NPLOS was to obtain data for estimating the amount of private land open for outdoor recreation in the United States and landowner practices and attitudes related to access to their lands for outdoor recreation. The NPLOS methodology, results, and the implications of these results are discussed after a brief review of recreation use of private land. This chapter ends by offering general conclusions about outdoor recreational use of private lands in the United States.",
