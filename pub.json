    "abstract": "Banking practices of variable loan rates are an important consideration in macroeconomics. This article argues that any empirical study on the inflation-unemployment trade-off requires the inclusion of the real interest rate in the model as any changes in the interest rate affect the capital use by the firms leading to an effect on the level of employment in the economy. To test the validity of this argument an empirical model is developed which includes the real interest rate as one of the explanatory variables in addition to inflation and real wages. The model is estimated using the annual time series data from the United Kingdom for the period from 1961 to 2005. The estimated results indicate that the interest rate variable is indeed significant in explaining the inflation-unemployment trade-off. A Wald test conducted also suggests that exclusion of real interest rate leads to a misspecification problem.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that any analysis of a Phillips curve should include the real interest rate in addition to inflation and real wages as any changes in the interest rate changes the labourâ€“capital input mix in the production process leading to a change in the level of employment in the economy. To justify this argument a Phillips curve model is developed, which includes the real interest rate in addition to inflation and real wages. After the diagnosis of the time series properties of the data, an error correction model is developed and estimated using a set of US annual data from 1948 to 1996. The estimated parameters of the model do suggest that one should really take into consideration of the real interest rate while analysing the Phillips curve. A nonnested test (F-test) also suggests that the Phillips curve model with real interest rate as an additional variable performs better than the conventional method that does not include the real interest rate.",

Specifically, the relationship between the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index and US inflation is investigated. The results show that the CRB index continues to be an effective early indicator of inflation. However, as the composition of the US economy changes, the CRB should continue to realign the index to maintain its longterm viability.",

    "abstract": "For several years, reports from the Trustees of the Social Security system have warned us that at the current rate of benefits and given the current age structure of our population, the Social Security system will go broke sometime between 2038 and 2042. To address Social Security Trustees' concerns, President Bush, in his postelection speech, reported that one of the legacies of his administration would be to reform the Social Security system. Farm operators tend to be older, on average, than people in other populations, meaning that changes in Social Security would more likely be of near-term concern to them. Although there is still considerable debate on whether reform is necessary or desirable, this article reports on what a changed Social Security system might look like, and how changes in the system might affect farmers' need for additional savings.",

    "abstract": "In this article issues concerning national commonalities and regional differences in the United States regarding private land and outdoor recreation are reviewed. Based on the particular cultural and political backgrounds of each region, it is hypothesized that landowners will exhibit degrees of differences in their attitudes regarding public access to private land. Data is from the latest decennial survey, the National Private Landowners Survey (NPLOS 1995-96), as well as from per capita state and local government spending on recreation, provided from the 1992 Census of Government. There is a discussion of the philosophical views on land in the United States, with some specifics for each region. It was found that there is a positive relationship between allowing public access to private land and the regional, state, and local spending on parks and recreation. The historical cultural differences between regions also seem to be of some importance, though not conclusive. Implications for marketing and income opportunities associated with fee-based private land recreation in different regions of the nation are discussed.",

From a supply perspective, BLM lands represent \"prime targets\" for meeting increased recreational demand in the western U.S. The BLM will face the challenge of balancing increased recreation use with other multiple uses, and minimizing the negative environmental impacts of increased recreation use such as damages caused by motorized vehicles, horses and foot traffic. In the future, the BLM will also face management challenges related to financing the provision of increased recreational opportunities",
